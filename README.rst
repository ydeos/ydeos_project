=============

This repository is the 'base' repository for the YDEOS project.

YDEOS stands for Yacht Design and Engineering Open Source.

The goal of the project is to provide open source software libraries and tools that are useful to design and engineering of (sailing and motor) yachts.


Features
--------

- Hydrodynamics computations
- Aerodynamics computations
- Velocity Prediction Program for sailing yachts
- Hydrostatics
- CFD cases generators
- Polars handling and visualization for sailing yachts
- Sailing regatta simulations
- Navigation formulas
- Sail shape analysis
- ... and more!


Contributing
------------

If you are an avid sailor, yacht designer, marine engineer or scientist with a passion for open source development, we would love to hear from you!


Help wanted
-----------

- User feedback
- Checks and tests
- IMS coefficients for the corresponding aero models
